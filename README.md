# it depends Manifesto

_Because there is not a silver bullet out there!_ 


## 1. Software artifacts are highly prone to horror
It does not matter how you'll implement your source code: it will suck for sure, somewhere, somehow.

## 2. Ctrl+C, ctrl+V
It does not matter how many best practices you will take: for sure you will press both Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V somewhere, somehow.

## 3. Despite the technology used, it will get old
Angular 1 anyone?

## 4. Buy technical books
Once obsolete they will turn in useful monitor stands!

## 5. The only stuff that does not depend
Your project will contain bugs.
